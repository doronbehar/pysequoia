# Security policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project,
please report it privately. Do not disclose it as a public issue. This
gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public
exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a
patch is released.

reasonable-effort basis. As such, please give us at least 90 days to
work on a fix before public exposure.

Thanks for helping make PySequoia safe for everyone!
